# GeneticAlgorithms
Genetic algorithm demo project where cars with neural network brains learn how to drive around a track.

I programmed the neural networks from scratch using only numpy. The basic idea is that a large amount of random weights are chosen for the first generation and then the best performing cars are used to create the next generation. Different techniques were used to do this including crossover and random variation.

Over time, the cars get better at navigating the course through the proccess of simulated evolution.
